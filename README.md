# Description:
This repository contains the code for a refrigerator management system capable of monitoring and displaying temperatures at different levels within the refrigerator. This system is designed to ensure food safety by providing real-time temperature data for various compartments or zones within the refrigerator.

# Key Features:

## Multi-Zone Temperature Monitoring:
The system can monitor temperatures at different levels or zones within the refrigerator, such as the freezer, fridge, and crisper compartments.

## Temperature Display:
Real-time temperature readings for each zone are displayed on a digital interface, allowing users to easily monitor the temperature status of their refrigerator.

## Temperature Logging:
The system logs temperature data over time, enabling users to track temperature trends and identify any fluctuations or anomalies.

## Temperature Alerts:
Users can set temperature thresholds for each zone and receive alerts or notifications if temperatures exceed predefined limits, helping to prevent food spoilage or safety concerns.
